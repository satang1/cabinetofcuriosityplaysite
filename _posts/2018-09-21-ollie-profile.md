## Awesome Animal Pick

I love the [Argonaut, or Paper Nautilus!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_(animal)), Paper nautiluses are the only living examples of their family, and are actually octopuses - the only ones with a shell! Their shells are actually egg cases, and they use them to 'gulp' air to facilitate flotation. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbZePKLDxNk) is an awesome video of one with an equally awesome soundtrack!!!

## Animal Family Member

The Paper Nautilus is part of the [Argonautidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautidae) family. This family is interesting because egg cases that have nodes, ribs, and a double keel are characteristic of the Argonauta genus, while all other egg cases that lack these features belong to the other 4 (extinct) genera. Another species in this family was the [Mizuhobaris izumoensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuhobaris), which was driven to extinction in 1913.
