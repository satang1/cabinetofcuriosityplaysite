## Awesome Animal Pick

I chose the [Tyrannosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus). I pick this one because they are giant but have tiny forelimbs"

## Animal Family Member

The Tyrannosaurus is part of the [Tyrannosauridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosauridae) family. Even though descended from smaller ancestors, they were almost always the largest predators in their respective ecosystems and at the apex of the food chain. One of the interesting facts about this family is that their legs were long and proportioned for fast movement, while their arms were very small, bearing only two functional digits. This family comprises two subfamilies containing up to thirteen genera, including the [Gorgosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgosaurus).
