## Awesome Animal Pick

I choose the [Axolotl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl), because it looks like a Pok√©mon and has many cool abilities including regenerating its limbs.

## Animal Family Member

Axolotl's family is [Ambystomatidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_salamander). What makes this family special is that "all mole salamanders are oviparous and lay large eggs in clumps in the water" (Wikipedia). They have wide-set eyes yet without true eyelids. Another species within this family is [tiger salamander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_salamander), as shown below.
